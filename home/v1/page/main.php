My name is David Joseph Vasko. I am the sixth child and my first name starts with 'd', hence the name "vasko6d". I am an avid rock climber with a passion for programming in Machine Learning applications: Image Recognition, NLU, computer Vision, Autonomous Navigation Systems and other Deep Learning topics. Coming from 2 years of industry experience with practical application of Facial Recognition in EMPI Matching Algorithms I want to continue pursuing similar challenges.

The 'Project' tab showcases some of the projects I was part of during my time at UCLA as a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate student, and Aerospace Engineering masters student.

The "Crossword" tab is a personal project that was originally created to allow a browser way for share homeade crosswords between my friend group. The project has gone stale of late but hopefully I will have time to revisit it soon. Both crosswords avaliable are ones that I designed myself.  NOTE: the crossword application does not currently work in Firefox. Tested in Current versions of Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. The current functionality of the crossword app is outlined at the bottom of the "Crossword" page.
