<h2> 2 Dimensional Flow in Supersonic Jet Inlet </h2>
<p>The following is a computational project I completed durring my Masters program at UCLA in the class "250D: Computational Aerodynamics." The project was to develop a two dimensional finite volume solver for a supersonic jet inlet. MacCormacks Method with artificial dissipation was utilized. Please view the <a href="/home/v1/pdf/Vasko_David_Presentation_Topic4.pdf"> presentation</a> I compiled, the <a href="/home/v1/pdf/Vasko_David_Report_Topic4.pdf"> full report</a> and download the <a href="/home/v1/pdf/source_code.zip"> source code</a> to see the awesomeness.  This project was done using MATLAB R2015a Student Version. The following figure is sample of the results section showing how the mach number drops abruptly across the oblique shocks. These oblique shocks are used intentionaly in jet engine inlets to slow down supersonic air.
