<h2> Completely Autonomous Billiard Ball Robot </h2>
For my capstone at UCLA, me and four other students were required to make a fully autonomous robot that could perform the following:
<ul>
	<li> Run completely autonomously </li>
	<li> Robot must have dimensions less than 1'x1'x1' </li>
	<li> In a 4' x 4' platform find a billiard ball </li>
	<li> Retrieve the billiard ball once found </li>
	<li> Deliver the billiard ball to a collection bin an the end of an inclined and ramp with three 90 degree turns</li>
	<li> Return to starting area </li>
	
</ul> 
We called our robot "MO" and below is a video of "MO" performing marvellously on demonstration day.

<h3> Design and Fabrication </h3>
The list below will give a quick snapshot of how the robot was made
<ul>
	<li> Modeled and analyzed using Solidworks 2013</li>
	<li> Programmed using Labview </li>
	<li> Structural parts machined on ULCA student machine shop</li>
	<li> Used SB-Rio board to wire and program robot </li>
	<li> Motors controlled with Pulse Width Modulation.</li>
	<li> Motor controller, motors, sensors, wheels and the rack and pinion were all purchased from online vendors.</li>	
</ul>
